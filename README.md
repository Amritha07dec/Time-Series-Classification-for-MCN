# Time Series Feature Learning for SINDy

This project focuses on **learning distinguishing features of dynamical systems** from synthetic time-series data generated by various ODE models.  
The models are categorized by polynomial **degree (1–4)** and are used to train and evaluate deep learning architectures for feature classification.

## 📁 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `ode_models_dictionary.py` | Contains definitions of ODE systems used for dataset generation, organized by degree. Includes separate sets for **training** and **validation**. |
| `main.py` | Main training pipeline — loads data, trains the model, and saves checkpoints. |
| `val.py` | Evaluation script — assesses model performance on the validation set. |
| `train.py` | Contains model architecture definitions and training functions. |
| `environment.yml` | Conda environment file — use this to recreate the exact environment setup. |

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

To recreate the same environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate <environment_name>


## 🚀 Usage

**Train the model**
```bash
python main.py

**Evaluate the model**
```bash
python val.py

## 🧠 Notes

- The dataset consists of time-series signals simulated from polynomial ODEs of varying degrees.  
- The goal is to train models capable of classifying systems based on underlying dynamical complexity.  
- Model architectures include LSTM variants and other sequence models.



## 📈 Future Work

- Extend the dataset with additional nonlinear systems and stochastic dynamics.  
- Experiment with frequency-domain and attention-based feature learning.  
- Integrate symbolic regression or SINDy-style sparse recovery for interpretability.  
- Explore Neural ODEs and Neural CDEs for continuous-time feature learning and improved representation of dynamical system trajectories.  
- Compare discrete recurrent models with continuous-time formulations to study generalization across varying temporal resolutions.
